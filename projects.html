            <h3>Automated Ploughing and Seeding Machine</h3>
            <p>The Automated Ploughing and Seeding Machine aims to transform traditional farming practices
                by using an Arduino Uno as its main controller. This system automates both ploughing and 
                seeding tasks, which minimizes manual labor and boosts efficiency. It operates on solar 
                energy, promoting sustainable energy use, while batteries and a regulated power supply 
                ensure that all components receive a steady power supply. A DTMF decoder allows for remote 
                control through a mobile keypad, enabling users to manage the machine via phone signals. 
                The ploughing mechanism is powered by a DC motor, and a servo motor accurately handles the 
                seeding process. The L293D motor driver facilitates smooth motor operation, and a 4-channel 
                relay module efficiently switches between different functions. This system provides a 
                cost-effective, eco-friendly, and automated approach to modern agriculture, significantly 
                improving productivity with minimal human involvement.</p><br><br><br>

            <h3>Smart Basket with Automated Billing and Inventory Management System</h3>
            <p>The Smart Basket with Automated Billing and Inventory Management System aims to improve 
                the shopping experience by utilizing Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega as the primary 
                controllers. This system automates the billing process, manages inventory, and enhances 
                security through various components. A USB barcode scanner is employed to scan items, 
                while an RFID tag and reader are used to authenticate users and facilitate secure 
                transactions. The Zigbee module enables wireless communication between the basket 
                module (Arduino Mega) and the counter module (Arduino Uno). A 16x2 LCD display offers 
                real-time updates on scanned items, total costs, and system notifications. Additionally, 
                a GSM module is included to send billing information and inventory updates via SMS. The 
                basket is secured with a DC motor, which is controlled by an L293D motor driver, allowing
                 it to lock and unlock based on user authentication. The system is powered by a regulated
                  power supply with rechargeable batteries to ensure consistent operation. This smart
                   basket simplifies the shopping process by minimizing checkout time, enhancing inventory
                 tracking, and improving security, making it a practical solution for contemporary retail
                 settings.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
