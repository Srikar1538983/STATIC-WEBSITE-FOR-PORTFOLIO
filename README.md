  The provided code is a "static portfolio website" created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in VS Code (Visual Studio Code). This website aims to display a developer’s skills, projects, and contact information in a well-organized and visually appealing manner. It is fully responsive, ensuring compatibility across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices. The site includes several sections: a homepage ('index.html'), an about page ('about.html'), a projects page ('projects.html'), and a contact page ('contact.htm'`).
  
  The homepage features a welcoming banner that displays the developer’s name, a brief introduction, and a button that directs users to the projects page. The about page offers insights into the developer, complete with an image and a short biography. The projects page showcases various projects, accompanied by images and descriptions, allowing visitors to grasp the developer’s work and expertise. The contact page contains a straightforward form where users can input their name, email, and message to get in touch with the developer.

  The CSS file ('styles.css') is utilized to enhance the website's appearance, ensuring it looks polished and professional. It includes styles for the navigation bar, hero section, about section, projects, and contact form. The JavaScript file ('script.js') can be employed to introduce interactivity, such as opening images in a new tab or validating the inputs in the contact form.

  This project is developed using VS Code, a powerful code editor that offers an excellent development environment, complete with extensions like Live Server for real-time previews, HTML CSS Support for improved code suggestions, and Prettier for code formatting. The developer can also take advantage of Path Intellisense to auto-complete file paths when linking images and CSS files.

  The goal of this portfolio website is to function as an online resume, allowing developers to showcase their skills and projects to potential employers.
